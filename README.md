# Kickstarter_Analysis_Challenge_Module1
Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
1) Download file and open with Excel for analysis
2) Use formulas and apply filters
3) Use pivot table to interpret data
4) Creating visualisations of the data 

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to analyse data to determine the needs of a client such as the goals and the launch date.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Numbers of outcomes were filtered only by "theater data" outcomes based on launch date by month

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The goal ranges was filtered by plays and splitted into groups of $5000. The outcomes were converted into percentage for each groups of $5000

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The canceled projects theater have limited data, reason why it shows a calculation error. For this, the  canceled data were filtered to make sure that there is no cancellation.


## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) The most successful theater project happens in May and June.

2) Beside the cancellations, the least successful theater project happens in December (starts descending from May to December)

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The outcomes based on goals show that the projects that are successful are the ones with less than $5000 goals and once the goal reaches $20000, the change of failure is greater. 

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The canceled theater have limited data.


#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A chart that will determine the timeline between the launch and the deadline underlining the success or failure of the outcome
